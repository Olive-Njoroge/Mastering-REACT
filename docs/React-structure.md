# 📁 Understanding the Structure of a React Project

A well-organized React project helps with readability, scalability, and collaboration. Below is a common folder structure and the purpose of each directory.

## 🗂️ Common React Project Structure

```

project-root/
│
├── public/             # Static files (index.html, favicon, etc.)
├── src/                # All application source code lives here
│   ├── assets/         # Images, fonts, icons, static assets
│   ├── components/     # Reusable UI components (e.g. Button, Navbar)
│   ├── pages/          # Route-level components (e.g. Home.jsx, About.jsx)
│   ├── routes/         # Route configurations using React Router
│   ├── utils/          # Utility/helper functions
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks (e.g. useAuth, useFetch)
│   ├── context/        # React context providers and state management
│   ├── services/       # API calls or external service integrations (e.g. Axios)
│   ├── styles/         # Global styles (e.g. Tailwind config or CSS files)
│   ├── App.jsx         # Root component that defines routes/layout
│   └── main.jsx        # Entry point that renders <App /> into the DOM
│
├── .gitignore
├── index.html          # Main HTML template (inside public/)
├── package.json
└── vite.config.js      # Vite configuration

## 📁 Folder Explanations

### 🔹 `components/`
Houses **reusable UI elements** like buttons, cards, modals, and navbars. These components are small and can be shared across multiple pages.

### 🔹 `pages/`
Each file here typically represents a **route or screen** in the app. Examples: `Home.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, `Dashboard.jsx`.

### 🔹 `utils/`
Stores **helper functions or constants** — for example, date formatters, math calculations, or validators.

### 🔹 `hooks/`
Custom **React Hooks** that encapsulate logic — e.g., `useAuth`, `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`.

### 🔹 `context/`
Includes **React Context Providers** for managing global state like themes, authentication, or app settings.

### 🔹 `services/`
Organizes all **API logic**, such as Axios instances and functions that call backend endpoints (e.g., `authService.js`, `userService.js`).

### 🔹 `routes/`
Stores your **React Router DOM** setup and routing logic. You can define nested routes and layouts here.

### 🔹 `assets/`
Images, fonts, icons, or any static media files used throughout the project.

### 🔹 `styles/`
Global CSS or SCSS files. If you're using Tailwind CSS, this can hold your `index.css` or `tailwind.config.js`.

## 🔧 Main Files

### `App.jsx`
- The root component of your app
- Usually defines the layout and routes using `react-router-dom`

### `main.jsx`
- The entry point where `App.jsx` is rendered to the DOM using `ReactDOM.createRoot`

---

## 📌 Tips

- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use folders inside `components/` and `pages/` for grouped features if your app scales
- Abstract logic into hooks and services for reusability

✅ A clean folder structure keeps your project organized and easier to navigate as it grows.
