What is React - React is a free, open-source JavaScript library used for building fast and interactive user interfaces — especially single-page applications (SPAs).

It allows developers to build UIs using components, which are reusable, isolated pieces of code that describe part of the UI.

What is Vite - Vite is a fast and modern frontend build tool that helps you start and develop web projects quickly.
It’s often used with frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte and is known for its blazing-fast dev server and instant hot module replacement (HMR).
